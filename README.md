# Pac-Man

Hello Everyone!!
This was project is just for fun (& learning - ignore this sadist). I made it with the help of ImKennyYip (you can search him using this) youtube tutorial with some modifications. He makes various games and also some lesson in python, java, html, css and javascript. But I have added some extensions to the original. Some of them are listed below:

1) Made three different levels for the player.
2) Added additional sacred ghost feature which activates for sometime if pacman eats a power food and its duration decreases with level. If eaten, ghosts position resets.
3) Added teleportation whenever pacman crosses the board area

Many features are still lacking, like the ghosts are not intelligent enough to follow pacman and they only change direction on collision with a wall. Sound effects can also be added to make the game interesting. Level 2 and 3 maps are not quite good, I generated them just for the sake of project. It is possible that I am missing some other defects, maybe I will try to fix them later.
